      ST. NICOLAS, Bishop of Myra in Lycia, lived in the time of Constantine the
      Great. The most ancient and weighty of those authors who have mentioned
      him celebrate his virtues, his labours, and his worth: they give abundant
      proofs of his sanctity; but none of them records the miracle of the
      salting-tub. Nor is it mentioned in the Golden Legend. This silence is
      important: still one does not willingly consent to throw doubt upon a fact
      so widely known, which is attested by the ballad which all the world
      knows:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;There were three little children
     In the fields they went to glean.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      This famous text expressly states that a cruel pork-butcher put the
      innocents &ldquo;like pigs into the salting-vat.&rdquo; That is to say, he apparently
      preserved them, cut into pieces, in a bath of brine. This is, to be sure,
      how pork is cured: but one is surprised to read further on that the three
      little children remained seven years in pickle, whereas it is usual to
      begin withdrawing the pieces of flesh from the tub, with a wooden fork, at
      the end of about six weeks. The text is explicit: according to the elegy,
      it was seven years after the crime that St. Nicolas entered the accursed
      hostelry. He asked for supper. The landlord offered him a piece of ham:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;&lsquo;Wilt eat of ham?   Tis dainty food.&rsquo; 
     &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll have no ham: it is not good.
     &lsquo;Wilt cat a piece of tender veal?
     &lsquo;I will not make of that my meal.
     Young salted flesh I want, and that
     Has lain seven years within the vat.
     Wheras the butcher heard this said
     Out of the door full fast he fled.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      The Man of God immediately resuscitated the tender victims by the laying
      of hands on the salting-tub.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such is, in substance, the story of the old anonymous rhyme. It bears the
      inimitable stamp of honesty and good faith. Scepticism seems ill-inspired
      when it attacks the most vital memories of the popular mind. It is not
      without a lively satisfaction that I have found myself able to reconcile
      the authority of the ballad with the silence of the ancient biographers of
      the Lycian pontiff. I am happy to proclaim the result of my long
      meditations and scholastic researches. The miracle of the salting-tub is
      true, in so far as essentials are concerned, but it was not the blessed
      Bishop of Myra who performed it; it was another St. Nicolas, for there
      were two: one, as we have already stated, Bishop of Myra in Lycia; the
      other more recent, Bishop of Trinqueballe in Vervignole. For me was
      reserved the task of distinguishing between them. It was the Bishop of
      Trinqueballe who rescued the three little boys from the salting-tub. I
      shall establish the fact by authentic documents, and no one will have
      occasion to deplore the end of a legend.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have been fortunate enough to recover the entire history of the Bishop
      Nicolas and the children whom he resuscitated. I have fashioned it into in
      a narrative which will be read, I hope, with both pleasure and profit.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER I
    </h2>
    <p>
      NICOLAS, a scion of an illustrious family of Vervignole, showed marks of
      sanctity from his earliest childhood, and at the age of fourteen vowed to
      consecrate himself to the Lord. Having embraced the ecclesiastical
      profession, he was raised, while still young, by popular acclamation and
      the wish of the Chapter, to the see of St. Cromadaire, the apostle of
      Vervignole, and first Bishop of Trinqueballe. He exercised his pastoral
      ministry with piety, governed his clergy with wisdom, taught the people,
      and feared not to remind the great of Justice and Moderation. He was
      liberal, profuse in almsgiving, and set aside for the poor the greater
      part of his wealth.
    </p>
    <p>
      His castle proudly lifted its crenelated walls and pepper-pot roofs from
      the summit of a hill overlooking the town. He made of it a refuge where
      all who were pursued by the secular arm might find a place of refuge. In
      the lower hall, the largest to be seen in all Vervignole, the table laid
      for meals was so long that those who sat at one end saw it lose itself in
      the distance in an indistinct point, and when the torches upon it were
      lighted it recalled the tail of the comet which appeared in Vervignole to
      announce the death of King Comus. The holy St. Nicolas sat at the upper
      end. There he entertained the principal folk of the town and of the
      kingdom, and a multitude of clergy and laymen. But on his right there was
      always reserved a seat for the poor man who might come begging for his
      bread at the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Children, particularly, aroused the solicitude of the good St. Nicolas. He
      delighted in their innocence, and he felt for them with the heart of a
      father and the bowels of a mother. He had the virtues and the morals of an
      apostle. Yearly, in the dress of a simple monk, with a white staff in his
      hand, he would visit his flock, desirous of seeing everything with his own
      eyes; and in order that no adversity or disorder should escape his notice
      he would traverse, accompanied by a single priest, the wildest parts of
      his diocese, crossing, in winter, the flooded rivers, climbing mountains,
      and plunging into the thick forests. One day, having ridden since dawn
      upon his mule, in company with the Deacon Modernus, thorny thickets
      through which his mount with difficulty forced a winding path. The Deacon
      Modernus followed him with much difficulty on his mule, which carried the
      baggage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Overcome with hunger and fatigue, the man of God said to Modernus:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us halt here, my son, and if you still have a little bread and wine
      we will sup here, for I feel that I hardly have the strength to proceed
      further, and you, although the younger, must be nearly as tired as I.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monseigneur,&rdquo; answered Modernus, &ldquo;there remains neither a drop of wine
      nor a crumb of bread; for, by your orders, I gave all to some people on
      the road, who had less need of it than ourselves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Without a doubt,&rdquo; replied the Bishop, &ldquo;had there been a few scraps left
      in your wallet we should have eaten them with pleasure, for it is fitting
      that those who govern the Church should be nourished on the leavings of
      the poor. But since you have nothing left it is because God has desired it
      so, and He has surely desired it for our good and profit. It is possible
      that He will for ever hide from us the reason of this favour: perhaps, on
      the other hand, He will quickly make it manifest. Meanwhile, I think the
      only thing left for us is to push on until we find some arbutus berries
      and blackberries for our own nourishment, and some grass for our mules,
      and, being thus refreshed, to lie down upon a bed of leaves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As you please, Monseigneur,&rdquo; answered Modernus, pricking his mount.
    </p>
    <p>
      They travelled all night, and a part of the following morning; then,
      having climbed a fairly steep ascent, they suddenly found themselves at
      the border of the wood, and beheld at their feet a plain covered by a
      yellowish sky, and crossed by four white roads, which lost themselves in
      the mist. They took that to the left, an old Roman road, formerly
      frequented by merchants and pilgrims, but deserted since the war had laid
      waste this part of Vervignole. Dense clouds were gathering in the sky,
      across which birds were flying; a stifling atmosphere weighed down upon
      the dumb, livid earth. Lightning flashed on the horizon. They urged on
      their wearied mules. Suddenly a mighty wind bent the tops of the trees,
      making the boughs crack and the battered foliage moan. The thunder
      muttered, and heavy drops of rain began to fall.
    </p>
    <p>
      As they made their way through the storm, the lightning flashing about
      them, along a road which had become a torrent, they perceived, by the
      light of a flash, a house outside which there hung a branch of holly, the
      sign of hospitality.
    </p>
    <p>
      The inn appeared deserted; nevertheless, the host advanced towards them, a
      man fierce yet humble, with a great knife at his belt, and asked what they
      wished for.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A lodging, and a scrap of bread, with a drop of wine,&rdquo; answered the
      Bishop, &ldquo;for we are weary and benumbed with cold.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While the host was fetching wine from the cellar, and Modernus was taking
      the mules to the stable, St. Nicolas, sitting at the hearth beside a dying
      fire, cast a glance round the smoky room. Dust and dirt covered the
      benches and casks; spiders spun their webs between the worm-eaten joists,
      whence hung scanty bunches of onions. In a dark corner the salting-tub
      displayed its iron-hooped belly.
    </p>
    <p>
      In those days the demons used to take a hand in domestic life in a far
      more intimate fashion than they do to-day. They haunted houses, concealed
      in the salt-box, the butter-tub, or some other hiding-place; they spied
      upon the people of the house, and watched for the opportunity to tempt
      them and lead them into evil. Then, too, the angels made more frequent
      appearances among Christian folk.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now a devil, as big as a hazel-nut, who was hidden among the burning logs,
      spoke up and said to the holy Bishop:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look at that salting-tub, Father; it is well worth a look. It is the best
      salting-tub in the whole of Vervignole. It is, indeed, the model and
      paragon of salting-tubs. When the master here, Seigneur Garum, received it
      from the hands of a skilful cooper he perfumed it with juniper, thyme, and
      rosemary. Seigneur Garum has not his equal in bleeding the meat, boning
      it, and cutting it up, carefully, thoughtfully, and lovingly, and steeping
      it in salted liquors by which it is preserved and embalmed. He is without
      a rival for seasoning, concentrating, boiling down, skimming, straining,
      and decanting the pickle. Taste his mild-cured pork, father, and you will
      lick your fingers: taste his mild-cured pork, Nicolas, and you will have
      something to say about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But in these words, and above all in the voice that uttered them (it
      grated like a saw), the holy Bishop recognized an evil spirit. He made the
      sign of the Cross, whereupon the little devil exploded with a horrible
      noise and a very bad smell, just like a chestnut thrown into the fire
      without having had its skin split.
    </p>
    <p>
      And an angel from Heaven appeared, resplendent in light and said to
      Nicolas:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nicolas, beloved of the Lord, you must know that three little children
      have been in that salting-tub for seven years; Garum, the innkeeper, cut
      up these tender infants, and put them in salt and pickle. Arise, Nicolas,
      and pray that they may come to life again. For, if you intercede for them,
      O Pontiff, the Lord, who loves you, will restore them to life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      During this speech Modernus entered the room, but he did not see the
      angel, nor did he hear him, for he was not sufficiently holy to be able to
      communicate with the heavenly spirits.
    </p>
    <p>
      The angel further said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nicolas, son of God, lay your hands on the salting-tub, and the three
      children will be resuscitated.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The blessed Nicolas, filled with horror, pity, zeal, and hope, gave thanks
      to God, and when the innkeeper reappeared with a jug in either hand, the
      Saint said to him in a terrible voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Garum, open the salting-tub!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Whereupon, Garum, overcome by fear, dropped both his jugs.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the saintly Bishop Nicolas stretched out his hands, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Children, arise!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At these words, the lid of the salting-tub was lifted up, and three young
      boys emerged.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Children,&rdquo; said the Bishop, &ldquo;give thanks to God, who through me, has
      raised you from out the salting-tub.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And turning towards the innkeeper, who was trembling in every limb, he
      said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cruel man, recognize the three children whom you shamefully put to death.
      May you loathe your crime, and repent, that God may pardon you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The innkeeper, filled with terror, fled into the storm, amidst the thunder
      and lightning.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER II
    </h2>
    <p>
      ST. NICOLAS embraced the three children and gently questioned them about
      the miserable death which they had suffered. They related that Garum,
      having approached them while they were gleaning in the fields, had lured
      them into his inn, had made them drink wine, and had cut their throats
      while they slept.
    </p>
    <p>
      They still wore the rags in which they had been clothed on the day of
      their death, and they retained, after their resurrection, a wild and timid
      air. The sturdiest of the three, Maxime, was the son of a half-witted
      woman, who followed the soldiers to war, mounted on an ass. One night he
      fell from the pannier in which she carried him, and was left abandoned by
      the roadside. From that time forward he had lived solely by theft. The
      feeblest, Robin, could hardly recall his parents, peasants in the
      highlands, who being too poor or too avaricious to support him had
      deserted him in the forest. The third, Sulpice, knew nothing of his birth,
      but a priest had taught him his alphabet. The storm had ceased; in the
      buoyant, limpid air the birds were calling loudly to one another. The
      smiling earth was green. Modernus having fetched the mules, Bishop Nicolas
      mounted his, and carried Maxime wrapped in his cloak: the deacon took
      Sulpice and Robin upon his crupper, and they set off toward the city of
      Trinqueballe.
    </p>
    <p>
      The road unfolded itself between fields of corn, vineyards, and meadows.
      As they went along the great Saint Nicolas who already loved the children
      with all his heart, examined them on subjects suitable to their age, and
      asked them easy questions such as: &ldquo;How much is five times five?&rdquo; or &ldquo;What
      is God?&rdquo; He obtained no satisfactory answers. But, far from shaming them
      for their ignorance, he thought only of gradually dissipating it by the
      application of the best pedagogic methods.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Modernus,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;we will teach them firstly the truths necessary for
      salvation, and secondly the liberal arts, especially music, so that they
      may sing the praises of the Lord. It will also be expedient to teach them
      rhetoric, philosophy, and the history of men, plants, and animals. I
      desire that they shall study, in their habits and their structure, the
      animals, all of whose organs, in their wonderful perfection, attest the
      glory of the Creator.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Scarcely had the venerable Pontiff concluded this speech when a peasant
      woman passed along the road, dragging by the halter an old mare so heavily
      laden with branches cut with their leaves on that her knees were
      trembling, and she stumbled at every step.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas,&rdquo; sighed the great St. Nicolas, &ldquo;here is a poor horse carrying more
      than its burden. He has unfortunately fallen into the hands of unjust and
      hard-hearted masters. One should not overload any creature, not even
      beasts of burden.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At these words the three boys burst out laughing. The Bishop having asked
      why they laughed so loudly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; said Robin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; said Sulpice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We laughed,&rdquo; said Maxime, &ldquo;because you mistook a mare for a horse. Can&rsquo;t
      you see the difference? It is very plain to me. Don&rsquo;t you know anything
      about animals?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think,&rdquo; said Modernus, &ldquo;the first thing is to teach these children
      manners.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At every town, borough, village, hamlet or castle by which he passed, St.
      Nicolas showed the people the children rescued from the salting-tub, and
      related the great miracle performed by God, on his intercession; whereupon
      they were all very joyful, and blessed him. Informed by messengers and
      travellers of so prodigious an occurrence, the entire population of
      Trinqueballe came out to meet their pastor, unrolling precious carpets and
      scattering flowers in his path. The citizens, their eyes wet with tears,
      gazed at the three victims who had escaped from the salting-tub, and
      cried: &ldquo;The Lord be praised!&rdquo; But the poor children knew no better than to
      laugh and stick out their tongues; this caused further wonder and
      compassion, as being a palpable proof of their innocence and misfortune.
    </p>
    <p>
      The saintly Bishop Nicolas had an orphan niece, Mirande by name, who had
      just reached her seventh year, and was dearer to him than the light of his
      eyes. A worthy widow by name Basine was rearing her in piety, good
      manners, and ignorance of evil. The three miraculously saved children were
      confided to the care of this lady. She was not lacking in judgment. She
      quickly saw that Maxime had courage, Robin prudence, and Sulpice the power
      of reflection. She devoted herself to confirming these good qualities,
      which, by the corruption common to the whole human race, tended
      unceasingly to become perverted and distorted; for Robin&rsquo;s cautiousness
      turned easily into hypocrisy, and mostly hid a greedy covetousness; Maxime
      was subject to fits of rage, and Sulpice frequently and obstinately
      expressed false ideas in very important matters. However, they were but
      mere children who went bird&rsquo;s-nesting, stole the garden fruit, tied
      cooking-pots to dogs&rsquo; tails, put ink the holy water font, and cow-itch in
      Modernus&rsquo; bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      At night, wrapped in white sheets and walking on stilts, they would go
      into the gardens, and frighten into a swoon the serving-maids belated in
      their lovers&rsquo; arms. They would cover the seat which Madame Basine was wont
      to use with bristling spikes, and when she sat down they would delight in
      her sufferings, observing the confusion with which she openly applied a
      heedful and comforting hand to the damaged spot, for she would not for all
      the world have been lacking in modesty.
    </p>
    <p>
      In spite of her age and virtues, this lady inspired them with neither love
      nor fear. Robin called her an old goat, Maxime an old she-ass, and
      Sulpice, the ass of Balaam. They teased little Mirande in all sorts of
      ways; they would dirty her pretty clothes by making her fall face downward
      on the stones. Once they pushed her head right up to the neck into a
      barrel of treacle. They taught her to sit astride railings, and to climb
      trees, contrary to the decorum of her sex; they taught her words and
      manners that smacked of the inn and the salting-tub. Following their
      example, she called Madame Bassne &ldquo;an old goat,&rdquo; and even, taking the part
      for the whole, &ldquo;old goat&rsquo;s rump.&rdquo; But she remained completely innocent.
      The purity of her soul was unchangeable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am fortunate,&rdquo; said the holy Bishop Nicolas, &ldquo;in that I rescued these
      children from the salting-tub, to make them good Christians. They will
      become faithful servants of God, and their merits will be accounted to
      me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Now, by the third year after their resurrection, when they were already
      tall and well-made, on a day of spring, as they were all playing in the
      field beside the river, Maxime in a moment of facetiousness and natural
      high spirits, threw the Deacon Modernus into the water. Hanging on to the
      branch of a willow-tree, Modernus called for help. Robin ran up, made as
      though to draw him out by the hand, took off his ring, and fled.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, Sulpice, sitting motionless on the bank with his arms crossed,
      said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Modernus is making a bad end. I can see six devils, in the form of
      flittermice, ready to seize his soul as it comes out of his mouth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When this serious affair was reported to him by Madame Basine and
      Modernus, the holy Bishop was much afflicted and fell a-sighing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;These children,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;were reared in suffering, by unworthy parents.
      The excess of their misfortunes has caused the deformity of their
      characters. We must redress their wrongs by enduring patience, and
      persevering kindness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monseigneur,&rdquo; answered Modernus, who was chattering with fever in his
      dressing-gown, and sneezing under his nightcap, for his bath had given him
      a cold, &ldquo;it is possible that their wickedness is derived from the
      wickedness of their parents. But how do you explain, father, the fact that
      neglect has produced in each of them different and, so to speak, contrary
      vices, and that the desertion and destitution into which they were thrown
      before they were put in the salting-tub has made one avaricious, a second
      violent, and the third a visionary? And in your place, my Lord, I should
      feel most uneasy about the last.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Each of these children,&rdquo; answered the Bishop, &ldquo;has yielded in his weak
      spot. Ill-treatment has deformed their souls in those portions that
      offered the least resistance. Let us straighten them out with a thousand
      precautions, for fear of increasing the evil instead of diminishing it.
      Mildness, clemency, and forbearance are the only means which should ever
      be employed for the improvement of men, heretics of course excepted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No doubt, Monseigneur, no doubt,&rdquo; said Modernus, sneezing three times.
      &ldquo;But you cannot have a good education without chastisement, nor discipline
      without discipline. I know what I am about. If you do not punish these
      three little ragamuffins, they will grow up worse than Herod. I assure you
      I am right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Modernus could not be mistaken,&rdquo; said Madame Basine.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Bishop did not answer. With the widow and the Deacon, he paced the
      length of a hawthorn hedge, which breathed forth an agreeable fragrance of
      honey and bitter almonds. In a slight hollow, where the soil received the
      water from a neighbouring spring, he stopped before a bush, whose twisted,
      close-packed branches were covered with gleaming, clean-cut leaves and
      white clusters of flowers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;at this leafy, fragrant shrub, this lovely may, this
      noble thorn-bush, so strong and vigorous. Observe that it is in more
      abundant leaf, and more glorious with bloom, than all the other thorns in
      the hedge. But notice also that the pale bark of its branches bears only a
      few thorns, which are weak and soft and blunt. What is the reason of this?
      It is because, growing in a rich, moist soil, quiet and secure in the
      wealth which sustains its life, it has utilized all the juices of the
      earth to augment its power and its glory, and being too strong to dream of
      arming against its feeble enemies, it has devoted itself entirely to the
      joys of its magnificent and delicious fertility. Now come a few steps up
      this rising path, and look at this other hawthorn, which having with
      difficulty issued from a dry, stony soil, languishes, deficient in both
      wood and leaves, and has had no other thought during its hard life than to
      defend itself against the innumerable enemies that threaten the weal. It
      is nothing but a bundle of thorns. It has employed the little sap which it
      received in fashioning innumerable spears, broad at the base, hard and
      sharp, which but ill restore confidence to its apprehensive weakness. It
      has nothing left over for fruitful and fragrant blossom. My friends, we
      are like the hawthorns. The care given to our childhood makes us better.
      Too harsh an up bringing hardens us.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER III
    </h2>
    <p>
      WHEN Maxime was approaching his seventeenth year he filled the holy Bishop
      Nicolas with grief and the diocese with scandal by forming and training a
      company of rogues of his own age, with a view to kidnapping the girls of a
      village called Grosses-Nates, situated at a distance of four leagues from
      Trinqueballe. The expedition was marvellously successful. The ravishers
      entered the village by night, clasping to their bosoms the dishevelled
      virgins, who vainly uplifted to heaven their burning eyes and imploring
      hands. But when the fathers, brothers, and betrothed of these ravished
      maidens sought them out, they refused to return to the place of their
      birth, alleging that they felt too deeply shamed, and preferred to hide
      their dishonour in <i>the</i> arms that had caused it. Maxime, who, for
      his share, had taken the three most beautiful, was living in their company
      in a little manor dependent upon the episcopal See. In the absence of
      their ravisher, the Deacon Modernus arrived, by order of the Bishop, to
      knock at their door, answering that he came to set them free. They refused
      to open; and when he represented to them the abomination of their lives
      they dropped upon his head a crockful of dishwater, with the crock, by
      which his skull was fractured.
    </p>
    <p>
      Armed with a gentle severity, the holy Bishop reproached Maxime for this
      violence and disorder:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;did I draw you from out of the salting-box to the ruin
      of the virgins of Vervignole?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And he reproached him with the magnitude of his offence. But Maxime
      shrugged his shoulders, and turned his back, without making any reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      At that moment King Berlu, in the fourteenth year of his reign, was
      assembling a powerful army to fight the Mambournians, the determined
      enemies of his kingdom, who, having entered Vervignole, were ravaging and
      depopulating the richest provinces of that great country.
    </p>
    <p>
      Maxime left Trinqueballe without saying goodbye to a soul. When he was
      some leagues distant from the town, seeing in a field a mare of moderate
      quality, except that she was blind in one eye and lame, he jumped on her
      back and galloped off. On the following morning, accidentally meeting a
      farm lad who was taking a great plough horse to water, he immediately
      dismounted, bestrode the great horse, and ordered the lad to mount the
      blind mare, and to follow him, saying that he would take him for his
      squire should he prove satisfactory. Thus equipped Maxime presented
      himself to King Berlu, who accepted his services. He became in a very
      short time one of Vervignole&rsquo;s greatest captains.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, Sulpice was giving the holy Bishop cause for perhaps more
      cruel, and certainly more momentous, uneasiness; for if Maxime sinned
      grievously, he sinned without malice, and offending God without thought,
      and, so to speak, unknowingly. But Sulpice set himself to do evil with a
      greater and more unusual malignity. Being destined from early youth for
      the Church he assiduously studied letters, both sacred and profane; but
      his soul was a corrupted vessel, wherein Truth was turned into Error. He
      sinned in spirit; he erred in matters of faith with surprising precocity.
      At an age when people have as yet no ideas at all, he overflowed with
      wrong ones. A thought occurred to him which was doubtless suggested by the
      devil. In a field belonging to the Bishop he gathered a multitude of boys
      and girls of his own age and, climbing into a tree, he exhorted them to
      leave their fathers and mothers to follow Jesus Christ, and to go in,
      parties through the country-side, burning priories and presbyteries in
      order to lead the Church back into evangelical poverty. This youthful mob,
      led away by emotion, followed the sinner along the roads of Vervignole,
      singing canticles, burning barns, pillaging chapels, and devastating the
      ecclesiastical lands. Many of these crazy creatures perished of fatigue,
      hunger, and cold, or were killed by villagers. The episcopal palace
      re-echoed with the complaints of the priesthood and the lamentations of
      mothers.
    </p>
    <p>
      The pious Bishop Nicolas sent for the originator of these disorders. With
      extreme mildness, and infinite sadness, he reproached him for having
      misused the Word for the misleading of souls, and reminded him that God
      had not picked him out of the salting-tub in order that he should attack
      the property of our Holy Mother, the Church.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Consider, my son,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;the greatness of your offence. You appear
      before your pastor charged with turmoil, sedition, and murder.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But young Sulpice, maintaining a horrid calm, answered with a voice full
      of assurance, that he had not sinned, neither had he offended God; but, on
      the contrary, he had acted in accordance with the bidding of Heaven, for
      the good of the Church. And he professed before the dismayed Bishop the
      false doctrines of the Manicheans, the Arians, the Nestorians, the
      Sabellians, the Vaudois, the Albigenses, and the Bégards. So eager was he
      to embrace these monstrous errors that he did not see how they
      contradicted one another, and were mutually devoured in the bosom that
      cherished and revived them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The pious Bishop endeavoured to lead Sulpice back into the right path, but
      he failed to overcome the unhappy lad&rsquo;s obstinacy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having dismissed him, he knelt and prayed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thank thee, O Lord, for having sent me this young man, as a whetstone
      on which to sharpen my patience and my charity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While two of the children he had rescued from the salting-tub were causing
      him so much pain, St. Nicolas was obtaining some consolation from the
      third. Robin showed himself neither violent in his actions nor arrogant in
      his thoughts. He had not the sturdy, ruddy appearance of Maxime; nor the
      grave, audacious manner of Sulpice. Small, thin, yellow, lined, and
      shrunken, of humble, obsequious and reverential bearing, he devoted
      himself to assisting the Bishop and clergy, helping the clerks to keep the
      accounts of the episcopal revenues, and making complicated calculations
      with the assistance of balls threaded on rods; he even multiplied and
      divided numbers in his head, without the use of slate or pencil, with a
      rapidity and accuracy that would have been admired even in a past master
      of money and finance. For him it was a pleasure to keep the books of the
      Deacon Modernus, who, growing old, used to muddle the figures and fall
      asleep at his desk. To oblige the Bishop, and obtain money for him, he
      spared neither trouble nor fatigue. From the Lombards, he learnt how to
      calculate both the simple and compound interest on a sum of money for a
      day, week, month, or year; he feared not to visit the filthy Jews in the
      black lanes of the Ghetto, in order to learn, by mingling with them, the
      standard of metals, the price of precious stones, and the art of clipping
      coin. Ultimately, with a little store which he had accumulated by
      marvellous industry in Vervignole, in Mondousiana, and even in Mambournia,
      he attended the fairs, tournaments, pardons, and jubilees, to which people
      of all conditions flocked from all parts of Christendom: peasants,
      burghers, clerics, and <i>seigneurs</i>; there he changed their money, and
      every time he returned a little richer than he had departed. Robin did not
      spend the money he had made, but brought it to the Bishop.
    </p>
    <p>
      St. Nicolas was extremely hospitable, and very liberal in almsgiving. He
      spent all his property and that of the Church in making gifts to pilgrims
      and assisting the unfortunate. Thus he continually found himself short of
      money; and he was much obliged to Robin for the skill and energy with
      which the young treasurer obtained the sums which he required. The
      condition of penury in which the holy Bishop had placed himself owing to
      his magnificence and liberality was greatly aggravated by the condition of
      the times. The war which was ravaging Vervignole also ruined the Church in
      Trinqueballe. The soldiery who were fighting in the country-side about the
      town pillaged the farms, levied contributions on the peasantry, drove out
      the religious orders, and burned the castles and abbeys.
    </p>
    <p>
      The clergy and the faithful could no longer contribute to the expenses of
      their creed, and thousands of peasants, fleeing from the free-booters came
      daily to beg their bread at the door of the episcopal palace. For their
      sakes, the good St. Nicolas felt the poverty which he had never felt for
      his own. Fortunately, Robin was always ready to lend him money, which the
      holy pontiff naturally agreed to return in more prosperous times.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alas, the war was now raging throughout the kingdom, from north to south,
      from east to west, attended by its two inseparable companions, famine and
      pestilence. The peasantry turned robbers, and the monks followed the
      armies. The inhabitants of Trinqueballe, having neither wood for firing,
      nor bread to eat, died like flies at the approach of winter. Wolves
      entered the outlying parts of the town, devouring little children. At this
      sad juncture, Robin came to inform the Bishop that not only was he unable
      to provide any further sum of money, however small, but that being unable
      to obtain anything from his debtors, and being pressed by his creditors,
      he had been compelled to hand over all his assets to the Jews.
    </p>
    <p>
      He brought this distressing news to his benefactor with the obsequious
      politeness which was usual to him; but he appeared a great deal less
      afflicted than he might have been in this grevions extremity. As a matter
      of fact, he was hard put to it to conceal, under a long face, his joyous
      feelings and his lively satisfaction. The parchment of his dry, humble,
      yellow eyelids ill concealed the light of joy which shone from his sharp
      eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sadly stricken, St. Nicolas remained quiet and serene under the blow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God will soon re-establish our declining affairs,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;He will not
      permit the house which He has built to be overthrown.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is true,&rdquo; said Modernus, &ldquo;but you may be sure that Robin, whom you
      drew out of the salting-tub, has made an arrangement with the Lombards of
      Pont-Vieux and the Jews of the Ghetto to despoil you, and that he is
      retaining the lion&rsquo;s share of the plunder.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Modernus spoke the truth. Robin had lost no money. He was richer than
      ever, and had just been appointed treasurer to the King.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IV
    </h2>
    <p>
      AT this time Mirande was nearing the close of her seventeenth year. She
      was beautiful, and well grown. An air of purity, innocence, and
      artlessness hung round her like a veil. The length of her eyelashes, which
      barred her blue eyes, and the childlike smallness of her mouth, gave the
      impression that evil could never find means to enter into her. Her ears
      were so tiny, so fine, so finished and so delicate, that the least modest
      of men could never have dared to breathe into them any but the most
      innocent of speeches. In the whole of Ver-vigbole no virgin inspired so
      much respect, and none had greater need to do so, for she was marvellously
      simple, credulous, and defenceless.
    </p>
    <p>
      The pious Bishop Nicolas, her uncle, cherished her more dearly every day,
      and was more deeply attached to her than one should be to any of God&rsquo;s
      creatures. He loved her, undoubtedly, in God; but he also loved her for
      herself; he took great delight in her, and he loved to love her; it was
      his only weakness. The Saints themselves are not always able to cut
      through all the ties of the flesh.
    </p>
    <p>
      St. Nicolas loved his niece, with a pure love, but not without
      gratification of the senses. On the day following that on which he had
      learned of Robin&rsquo;s bankruptcy, he went to see Mirande in order to hold
      pious converse with her, as was his duty, for he stood in the place of a
      father to her, and had taken charge of her education.
    </p>
    <p>
      She lived in the upper town, near the Cathedral in a house called &ldquo;The
      House of the Musicians,&rdquo; because there were to be seen on its front men
      and animals playing on divers instruments. There were, notably, an ass
      playing a flute, and a philosopher, recognizable by his long beard and
      ink-horn, clashing cymbals. Every one explained these figures according to
      his fancy. It was the finest dwelling-house in the town.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Bishop found his niece crouching on the floor, with dishevelled hair,
      her eyes glittering with tears, by the side of an empty, open coffer, in a
      room full of confusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      He inquired of her the reason of this affliction, and of the disorder that
      prevailed around her. Turning upon him her despairing gaze, she told him
      with a thousand sighs that Robin, the Robin who had escaped from the
      salting-tub, the darling Robin, having many a time told her that if she
      ever wanted a dress, an ornament or a jewel, he would gladly lend her the
      money wherewith to buy it, she had frequently had recourse to his
      kindness, which appeared inexhaustible; but that very morning a Jew called
      Seligmann had come to her with four sheriff&rsquo;s officers, had presented the
      notes, signed by herself, which she had given Robin, and as she had not
      the money to pay them he had taken away all the clothes, head-dresses and
      jewels which she possessed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has taken,&rdquo; she sobbed, &ldquo;my bodices and petticoats of velvet, brocade
      and lace; my diamonds, my emeralds, my sapphires, my jacinths, my
      amethysts, my rubies, my garnets, and my turquoises; he has taken my great
      diamond cross, with angels&rsquo; heads in enamel, my large necklace, consisting
      of two table diamonds, three cabochons, and six knots each of four pearls;
      he has taken my great collar of thirteen table diamonds, and twenty
      hanging pearls!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And without saying more she wept bitterly into her handkerchief.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My daughter,&rdquo; answered the saintly Bishop, &ldquo;a Christian virgin is
      sufficiently adorned when she wears modesty for a necklace, and chastity
      for a girdle. None the less, as the scion of a most noble and most
      illustrious family it was right that you should wear diamonds and pearls.
      Your jewels were the treasury of the poor, and I deplore the fact that
      they should have been snatched from you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He assured her that she would certainly recover them, either in this world
      or the next; he said everything possible to assuage her regret, and soothe
      her sorrow, and he comforted her. For she had a tender soul, which longed
      for consolation. But he himself left her full of affliction.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the following day, as he was about to celebrate Mass in the cathedral,
      the holy Bishop saw coming towards him, in the sacristy, the three Jews,
      Seligmann, Issachar, and Meyer, who, wearing green hats and fillets upon
      their shoulders, very humbly presented him the notes which Robin had made
      over to them. As the venerable pontiff could not pay diem, they called up
      twenty porters, with baskets, sacks, picklocks, carts, cords, and ladders,
      and commenced to pick the locks of the wardrobes, coffers, and
      tabernacles. The holy man cast on them a look which would have destroyed
      three Christians. He threatened them with the penalties of sacrilege, both
      in this world and the next, he pointed out that their mere presence in the
      house of the God, whom they had crucified, called down the fire of heaven
      upon their heads. They listened with the calm of people for whom anathema,
      reprobation, malediction, and execration were their daily bread. He then
      prayed to them, besought them, and promised to pay as soon as he could,
      twofold, threefold, tenfold, a hundredfold, the debt which they had
      acquired. They excused themselves politely for being unable to postpone
      the little transaction. The Bishop threatened to sound the tocsin, to
      rouse against them the people who would kill them like dogs for profaning,
      violating, and stealing the miraculous images and holy relics. They
      smilingly pointed to the sheriff&rsquo;s officers, who were guarding them. They
      were protected by King Berln, for they lent him money. At this sight the
      holy Bishop, recognizing that resistance would be rebellion, and
      remembering Him who replaced the ear of Malchus, remained inert and
      speechless, and bitter tears dropped from his eyes. Seligmann, Issachar,
      and Meyer took away the golden shrines enriched with precious stones,
      enamels and cabochons, the reliquaries in the form of chalices, lanterns,
      naves, and towers, the portable altars of alabaster encased in gold and
      silver, the coffers enamelled by the skilful craftsmen of Limoges and the
      Rhine, the altar-crosses, the Gospels bound in carved ivory and antique
      cameos, the desks ornamented with festoons of trailing vines, the consular
      registers, the pyxes, the candelabra and candlesticks, the lamp, of which
      they blew out the sacred flame, and spilt the blessed oil on the tiles,
      the chandeliers like enormous crowns, the duplets with beads of pearl and
      amber, the eucharistie doves, the ciboria, the chalices, the patens, the
      kisses of peace, incense boxes and flagons, the innumerable ex-votos&mdash;hands,
      arms, legs, eyes, mouths, and hearts, all of silver&mdash;the nose of King
      Sidoc, the breast of Queen Blandine, and the head in solid gold of Saint
      Cromadaire, the first apostle of Vervignole, and the blessed patron of
      Trinqueballe. They even carried off the miraculous image of St. Gibbosine,
      whom the people of Vervignole had never invoked in vain in time of
      pestilence, famine, or war. This very ancient and venerable image was made
      of leaves of beaten gold nailed upon a core of cedar-wood, and was covered
      with precious stones of the bigness of ducks&rsquo; eggs, which emitted fiery
      rays of red, blue, yellow and violet and white. For the past three hundred
      years her enamelled eyes, wide open in her golden face, had compelled such
      respect from the inhabitants of Trinqueballe that they saw her in their
      dreams, splendid and terrible, threatening them with the direst penalties
      if they failed to supply her with sufficient quantities of virgin- wax and
      crown-pieces. St. Gibbosine groaned, trembled, and tottered on her
      pedestal, and allowed herself to be carried away without resistance, out
      of the basilica to which, from time immemorial, she had drawn innumerable
      pilgrims.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the departure of these sacrilegious thieves the holy Bishop Nicolas
      ascended the steps of the despoiled altar, and consecrated the blood of
      our Lord in an old silver chalice, of German origin, thin and deeply
      dented. He prayed for the afflicted, and in particular for Robin, whom, by
      the will of God, he had rescued from the salting-box.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER V
    </h2>
    <p>
      SHORTLY after this, King Berlu defeated the Mambournians in a great
      battle. He was, at first, unaware of the fact, for armed conflicts always
      present a great confusion, and during the last two hundred years the
      Vervignolians had lost the habit of victory. But the precipitate and
      disordered flight of the Mambournians informed him of his advantage.
      Instead of fighting a rear-guard action he pursued the enemy, and regained
      half his kingdom. The victorious army entered the city of Trinqueballe,
      all beflagged and beflowered in its honour, and in that illustrious
      capital of Vervignole it committed a great number of rapes, thefts,
      murders, and other cruelties, burnt several houses, sacked the churches,
      and took from the cathedral all that the Jews had left there, which, truth
      to tell, was not much.
    </p>
    <p>
      Maxime, who having become a knight and commander of eighty lances, had
      largely contributed to the victory, was one of the first to enter the
      city, and repaired straightway to the House of the Musicians, where dwelt
      the beautiful Mirande, whom he had not seen since his departure for the
      war. He found her in her bower, plying her distaff, and fell upon her with
      such impetuosity that the young lady lost her innocence without, so to
      speak, realizing that she had done so. And when, having recovered from her
      surprise, she exclaimed: &ldquo;Is it you, Seigneur Maxime? What are you doing
      here?&rdquo; and was preparing as in duty bound to resist her aggressor, he was
      quietly walking down the street, readjusting his armour and ogling the
      girls.
    </p>
    <p>
      Possibly she would have entirely overlooked this offence, had it not been
      that some time later she found that she was about to become a mother.
      Captain Maxime was then fighting in Mambournia. All the town knew her
      shame: she confided it to the great St. Nicolas, who, on learning this
      astonishing news, lifted his eyes to heaven, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lord, did you rescue this man from the salting-tub only as a ravening
      wolf to devour my sheep? Your wisdom is adorable; but your ways are dark,
      and your designs mysterious.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And in that same year, on the Sunday of Mid-Lent, Sulpice threw himself at
      the feet of the holy Bishop, saying:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From my earliest youth, my keenest wish has been to consecrate myself to
      the Lord. Allow me, father, to embrace the monastic state, and to make my
      profession in the monastery of the mendicant friars of Trinqueballe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My son,&rdquo; answered the good St. Nikolas, &ldquo;there is no worthier condition
      than that of the monk. Happy is he who in the shade of the cloister takes
      shelter from the tempests of the age. But of what avail to flee the storm
      if the storm is within oneself? Of what avail to affect an outward show of
      humility, if one&rsquo;s bosom contains a heart full of pride? What shall you
      profit by donning the livery of obedience if your soul be in revolt? I
      have seen you, my son, fall into more errors than Sabellius, Alius,
      Nestorius, Eutyches, Manes, Pelagius, and Pachosius combined, and revive,
      before your twentieth year, twelve centuries of peculiar opinions. It is
      true that you have not been very obstinate in any of them, but your
      successive recantations appear to betray less submission to our Holy
      Mother the Church than eagerness to rush from one error to another, to
      leap from Manicheeism to Sabellianism, and from the crime of the
      Albigenses to the ignominies of the Vaudois.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sulpice listened to this discourse with a contrite heart, a simplicity of
      mind and submissiveness, that drew tears from the great St. Nicolas.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I deplore, repudiate, condemn, reprove, detest, execrate, and abominate
      my errors, past, present, and future,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I submit myself to the
      Church fully and entirely, totally and generally, purely and simply; and I
      have no belief but her belief, no faith but her faith, no knowledge but
      her knowledge: I neither see, hear, nor feel, save only through her. She
      might tell me that the fly which has but now settled on the nose of the
      Deacon Modernus was a camel, and I should incontinently, without dispute,
      contest, murmur, resistance, hesitation or doubt, believe, declare,
      proclaim, and confess, under torture and unto death, that it was a camel
      that settled on the nose of the Deacon Modernus. For the Church is the
      Fountain of Truth, and I am nought by myself but a vile receptacle of
      Error.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take care, my father,&rdquo; said Modernus. &ldquo;Sulpice is capable of overdoing
      submission to the Church even to the point of Heresy. Do you not see that
      he submits with frenzy, in transports and swooning? Is wallowing in
      submission a good way of submitting? He is annihilating himself; he is
      committing suicide.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the Bishop reprimanded his deacon for holding such ideas, which were
      contrary to charity, and sent the postulant to the noviciate of the
      mendicant friars of Trinqueballe.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alas, at the end of a year those priests, till then so quiet and humble,
      were torn by frightful schisms, plunged into a thousand errors against the
      Catholic truth, their days filled with disorder, and their souls with
      sedition! Sulpice inspired the brothers with this poison. He sustained
      against his superiors that there was no longer any true Pope, since
      miracles no longer accompanied the elections of the Sovereign Pontiffs;
      nor, rightly speaking, any Church, since Christians had ceased to live the
      life of the apostles and the first of the faithful; that there was no
      purgatory; that it was not necessary to confess to a priest if one
      confessed to God; that men do wrong in making use of moneys of gold and
      silver, for they should share in common the fruits of the earth. These
      abominable maxims, which he forcibly sustained, were combated by some, and
      adopted by others, causing horrible scandals. A little later Sulpice
      taught the doctrine of perfect purity, which nothing can soil, and the
      good brothers&rsquo; monastery became like a cage of monkeys. This pestilence
      did not remain confined within the walls of a monastery. Sulpice went
      preaching through the city; his eloquence, the internal fire by which he
      was consumed, the simplicity of his life, and his unshakable courage
      touched all hearts.
    </p>
    <p>
      On hearing the voice of the reformer, the ancient city, evangelized by St.
      Cromadaire, and enlightened by St. Gibbosine, fell into disorder and
      dissolution; every sort of extravagance and impiety was committed there,
      by day and by night. In vain did the great St. Nicolas warn his flock by
      exhortations, threats, and fulminations. The evil increased unchecked, and
      it was sad to see the contagion spreading itself among the well-to-do
      townsfolk, the lords, and the clergy, as much as and more than among the
      poor artisans and the small tradesfolk.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day when the man of God was lamenting the deplorable state of the
      church of Vervignole in the cloister of the cathedral, his meditations
      were disturbed by strange shrieks, and he saw a woman, stark naked,
      walking on all fours, with a peacock&rsquo;s feather for a tail. As she came
      nearer, she barked, sniffed, and licked the ground. Her fair head was
      covered with mud, and her whole body was a mass of filth. In this unhappy
      creature the holy Bishop Nicolas recognized his niece Mirande.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you there, my daughter?&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Why are you naked, and
      wherefore do you walk on your hands and knees? Have you no shame?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, uncle, I am not ashamed,&rdquo; sweetly replied Mirande. &ldquo;I should, on the
      contrary, be ashamed of any other gesture, or method of progression. If
      one wishes to please God, it is thus that one should behave. The holy
      Brother Sulpice taught me to conduct myself thus, in order to resemble the
      beasts, who are nearer to God than is Man, in that they have not sinned.
      So long as I am in the state in which you see me, there will be no danger
      of my sinning. I have come, uncle, to beg you in all love and charity to
      do likewise; for unless you do you cannot be saved. Remove, I beg, your
      clothes, and adopt the posture of the animals, in whom God joyfully sees
      His image which has not been distorted by sin. I give you this advice by
      order of the holy brother Sulpice, and consequently by order of God
      Himself, for the holy brother is in the Lord&rsquo;s secrets. Strip yourself
      naked, uncle, and come with me, so that we may show ourselves to the
      people for their edification.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can I believe my eyes and ears?&rdquo; gasped the holy Bishop, whose voice was
      stifled by sobs. &ldquo;I had a niece blooming in beauty, virtue, and piety; the
      three children whom I rescued from the salting-tub have reduced her to the
      miserable condition in which I now see her. The first has despoiled her of
      all her property, an abundant source of alms, and the patrimony of the
      poor; the second has robbed her of her honour, and the third has turned
      her into a heretic.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He threw himself on the flagstones, embracing his niece, begging her to
      renounce so evil a way of life, and adjuring her to reclothe herself, and
      walk on her feet like a human being, ransomed by the blood of Jesus
      Christ.
    </p>
    <p>
      But she replied only by sharp yelps and lamentable shrieks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before long the town of Trinqueballe was filled with naked men and women,
      walking on all fours and barking; they called themselves the Edenites, and
      their ambition was to lead back the world to the times of perfect
      innocence, before the unfortunate creation of Adam and Eve.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Reverend Father Gilles Caquerole, a Dominican, inquisitor of the faith
      in the city, university, and ecclesiastical province of Trinqueballe,
      became uneasy concerning this novelty, and proceeded to look into it
      minutely. In the most urgent fashion, by letters under his seal, he
      invited the Bishop Nicolas, in co-operation with himself, to arrest,
      imprison, interrogate, and sentence these enemies of God, and especially
      their principal leaders, the Franciscan monk, Sulpice, and a dissolute
      woman named Mirande. The great St. Nicolas burned with an ardent zeal for
      the unity of the Church and the destruction of heresy, but he dearly loved
      his niece. He hid her in the episcopal palace, and refused to hand her
      over to the inquisitor Caquerole, who denounced him to the Pope as an
      abettor of disorder and the propagator of a new and very detestable
      heresy. The Pope enjoined Nicolas to no longer withhold the guilty one
      from her legitimate judges. Nicolas eluded the injunction, protested his
      obedience, and did not obey. The Pope fulminated against him in the Bull
      <i>Maleficus pastor</i>, in which the venerable pontiff was accused of
      being a disobedient member of the Church, a heretic, or one smelling of
      heresy, a keeper of concubines, a committer of incest, a corrupter of the
      people, an old woman and a meddling old fool, and was passionately
      admonished.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this way the Bishop did himself a great deal of harm without any
      benefit to his beloved niece. King Berlu, having been threatened with
      excommunication if he did not lend his secular arm to the Church in
      pursuit of the Edenites, sent some men-at-arms to the episcopal palace of
      Trinqueballe.
    </p>
    <p>
      They tore Mirande from her asylum: she was brought before the inquisitor
      Caquerole, thrown into a deep dungeon, and fed upon bread which the
      jailers&rsquo; dogs had refused; but what afflicted her most was that she was
      forcibly compelled to don an old frock and a hood, and that she could no
      longer be certain of not sinning.
    </p>
    <p>
      The monk Sulpice escaped the investigations of the Holy Office and
      succeeded in reaching Mambournia, and found an asylum in a monastery of
      that kingdom, where he established new sects even more pernicious than the
      previous one.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless, heresy, fortified by persecution, and exulting in danger,
      now spread its ravages over the whole of Vervignole. All over the kingdom
      there were seen in the fields thousands of naked men and women, nibbling
      the grass, bleating, lowing, roaring, neighing, and contending at night
      with sheep, cattle, and horses for the use of stable and manger. The
      inquisitor informed the Holy Father of these horrible scandals, and warned
      him that so long as the Protector of the Edenites, the odious Nicolas,
      remained seated on the throne of St. Cromadaire, the evil could only
      continue to increase. Conformably with this advice the Pope hurled against
      the Bishop, like a thunderbolt, the Bull <i>Deterrima quondam</i>, by
      which he deprived him of all his ecclesiastical functions, and cut him off
      from the communion of the faithful.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VI
    </h2>
    <p>
      CRUSHED by the Vicar of Jesus Christ, steeped in bitterness, overwhelmed
      by affliction, the holy Nicolas stepped down without regret from his
      illustrious seat, and departed, no more to return thither, from the city
      of Trinqueballe, which for thirty years had witnessed his pontifical
      virtues and apostolic labours. There is in western Vervignole a lofty
      mountain, whose peals are covered with perpetual snow; from its flanks
      there descend, in spring, the foaming sonorous cascades that fill the
      valley torrents with a water as blue as the sky. There, in a region where
      grow the larch, the arbutus, and the hazel, some hermits supported
      themselves on berries and milk. This mountain is called that of the
      Saviour. It was here that St. Nicolas resolved to take refuge, and, far
      from the world, to weep for his sins and those of man.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he was climbing the mountain in search of some wild spot where he might
      establish his habitation, having emerged above the clouds which are almost
      always gathered about the flanks of the peak, he saw upon the threshold of
      a hut an old man sharing his bread with a tame hind. His hair fell over
      his forehead, and nothing could be perceived of his face but the tip of
      his nose and a long white beard.
    </p>
    <p>
      The holy Nicolas greeted him with these words:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Peace be with you, brother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It delights to dwell upon this mountain,&rdquo; answered the recluse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I also,&rdquo; replied the holy Nicolas, &ldquo;have come hither to end, in calm,
      days which have been disturbed by the tumult of the times and the
      malignity of men.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he was speaking in this wise, the hermit gazed at him attentively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you not,&rdquo; he said at length, &ldquo;the Bishop of Trinqueballe, that
      Nicolas whose work and virtues are extolled by men?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When, by a sign, the holy pontiff admitted that he was that man, the
      hermit threw himself at his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monseigneur, to you I owe the saving of my soul, if, as I hope, my soul
      is saved.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nicolas raised him with kindness, and asked him:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My brother, how have I had the happiness to work for your salvation?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Twenty years ago,&rdquo; replied the recluse, &ldquo;when I was an innkeeper at the
      edge of a wood, on a deserted road, I saw one day, in a field, three
      little children gleaning. I lured them to my house, gave them wine to
      drink, cut their throats in their sleep, cut them up into small pieces,
      and salted them. On seeing them emerge from the salting-tub I was frozen
      with terror; owing to your exhortations my heart melted; I experienced a
      salutary repentance, and, fleeing from men, I came to this mountain, where
      I consecrated my days to God. He bestowed His peace upon me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What,&rdquo; cried the holy Bishop, &ldquo;you are that cruel Garum, guilty of so
      heinous a crime! I praise God that he has accorded you a peaceful heart,
      after the horrible murder of three children, whom you put in the
      salting-tub like pigs; but as for me, alas! for having drawn them out of
      it my life has been filled with tribulation, my soul steeped in
      bitterness, and my Bishopric laid wholly desolate. I have been deposed,
      excommunicated by the common Father of the Faithful. Why have I been so
      cruelly punished for what I did?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us worship God,&rdquo; said Garum, &ldquo;and let us not ask His motives.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The great St. Nicolas, with his own hands, built a hut near that of Garum,
      and there, in prayer and penitence, he ended his days.
